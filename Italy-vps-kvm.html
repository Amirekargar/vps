<p><strong>TheServerHost Italy VPS with KVM Virtualization</strong></p>
<p>Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a very powerful virtualization technology inside the Linux kernel, which enables the kernel to act as a virtualizer. The main goal of KVM is to provide an easy way for the Linux operating system's developers to create multiple virtual machines without having to deal with complex device management. For developers, it is an ideal solution for testing and debugging different VPS using the Linux infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, KVM works using the Linux kernel. A supervisor will be present on the kernel level, and all the servers running in a KVM virtualized environment will share one common server memory. They will also be able to communicate with each other efficiently since they share the same supervisor. For many people, this is the most important advantage of using KVM. After all, the ability to use the same kernel without needing to use a specific OS makes things much simpler.</p>
