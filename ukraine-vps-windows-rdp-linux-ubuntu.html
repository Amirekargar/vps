<p><strong>Windows RDP OS</strong></p>
<p>An overview of Windows Server management is usually part of a larger Windows Server deployment. Intermediate and introductory aspects of Windows Server management. Outcomes include configuration of the Windows Server operating systems, installation of the latest Windows Server operating system, installation of hardware devices, installation of software devices, configuration of network services, knowledge of Active Directory and group policy, and understanding of Windows Networking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows Server OS comes with many valuable features that make it preferable over other server operating systems. In addition to these factors, Microsoft Windows Server is much more secure than its other competitors. Many small businesses have been operating their servers on Linux environment but have found out that it is more complicated to manage the server than Windows. Windows Servers also provides excellent security features, which help them protect the network of the organization from unauthorized users. On the other hand, the chief disadvantage of using Windows server is the licensing. Windows server is priced very high and needs to be licensed on an individual basis to Linux based servers do not need to be licensed on an individual basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from the above mentioned factors, Microsoft Windows can also provide excellent system support and assistance to users if needed. This advantage over its competitors has helped Windows gain the most number of users. However, it is essential to ensure that the user has sufficient technical knowledge and expertise to run the system. For this purpose, one can opt for a third party application that helps them with system support and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Linux OS</strong></p>
<p>Linux Operating System is a family of freely distributed Unix-like Operating Systems based on the Linux kernel, a core operating system first released in Linux kernel 6.X/ kernel 3.x/PPC. Linux is usually packaged with free software such as the Fedora and Red Hat distributions. However, Linux can also be purchased or downloaded for a cost. The Linux Operating System can be used for server computers, desktop computers, laptops and web servers. Linux supports multiple architectures, packages and features such as UNIX service, IIS, PHP, CGI, MySQL, MS SQL and Apache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Linux offers a free and open-sourced operating system and can be used as a server and workstation operating system. It is one of the most widely used and versatile forms of Linux and is used for general purpose computing across multiple platforms. One of the reasons why Linux became popular is because of its free license that guarantees the freedom to use, study and distribute. With such a big base of support and a large user base, Linux now dominates the operating system market. There are two main varieties of Linux such as Lineage and Ubuntu, which differ in their kernels and other aspects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated earlier, distributions like Fedora and Opensuse are primarily designed to provide a user friendly and easy to use environment to Linux users. So it does not require you to use complicated command lines or shell scripts. It provides a very simple graphical interface that makes Linux Administration easy. Many people consider Linux distributions like Fedora or Opensuse as a good option if you want to start using a low resource operating system without spending lots of money on buying expensive hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu OS&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ubuntu Operating System is the most popular and widely used Linux distribution in the world. The main advantage of Ubuntu over Macos is that Linux has better control over system processes. The Ubuntu system uses the concept of service management to provide the user a graphical user interface which makes it easier to administer various services. This makes it easier to customize certain aspects of the operating system while using a web browser on the web server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the reasons why Ubuntu remains a popular open-source operating system is that it is very easy to install and run. It is packaged and built by the Ubuntu community and hence you don't have to spend any money to be able to try out and use it. Also, the official website has an interactive desktop environment that helps you get started with using Ubuntu. It provides help documentation and a comprehensive guide for getting the most out of the open-source Linux distribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another great thing about Ubuntu Linux is that it comes with a wide range of libraries and tool kits ranging from the most basic file sharing applications to the most advanced ones. So, if you are a beginner and are looking for a simple, easy to work with and powerful distribution then the Ubuntu Linux will fit you just fine. However, if you are more concerned with robustness and functionality of a distribution then the MacOS X and Windows can satisfy your needs better. In my opinion, the best thing about Ubuntu and its derivatives is that they are the most widely used free, open source programs today.</p>
