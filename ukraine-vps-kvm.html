<p><strong>KVM Virtualization&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KVM Virtualization is an advanced virtualization technology offering full support for virtualized servers on a dedicated virtual operating system. The aim of this project is to provide OpenVZ as the first Open Source hypervisor in the market. KVM is extremely useful in visualizing business applications and in particular is being used for virtual servers, which are running on UNIX or other non-xenlinar platforms. The main advantage of using KVM for virtualizing servers is that it is easier to use than most of the other alternatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KVM Virtualization is an advanced virtualization technology offering full support for virtualized servers on the x86 architecture and it also supports all major operating platforms including Linux. It is developed by Red Hat Technologies to offer a hypervisor service and solution on the Linux kernel platform. It is based on the kernel technology provided by the Linux kernel. Xen is the main operating system for KVM and supporting Xen and Hypervisor in one tool is quite beneficial for the users. KVM is the better option if you want to deploy virtual servers on your desktop or if you want to run many virtual environments on a single computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storage pools and volumes are very important for virtual server management. With the help of storage pools, you can create multiple virtual servers with the same physical hardware. You can even assign them different port groups. With the help of the Volume Shadowing service, you can make your desktop unavailable during the time of system maintenance. To make your desktop unavailable, you can create a KVM virtualized storage pool and create an isolated isolation space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xen is an advanced virtualization technology. It has the ability to patch the operating system and carry out a variety of other functions. This feature comes along with the KVM hypervisor that provides the Xen support.</p>
